# facial_recognition_test
This was a test I was conducting for facial recognition systems.
The main objective was to be able to scan a face, generate a faceprint (unique features within each face like fingerprints), 
store the faceprint in a database(mysql) and retrieve it in future to compare with other face prints in future.
The test was successful.

This is a sample system that can help individuals looking into facial recognition technology to get started.
